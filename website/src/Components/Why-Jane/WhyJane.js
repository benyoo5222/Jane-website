            You (activity/recreational therapy director) are constantly thinking

            <u>As a musician for over 40+ years</u>, she started her career as a

            By playing songs that your residents will be familiar with such as
            movie sound tracks, pop songs, folk songs, and hymns, it will allow

              <strong>Why Music over other activities?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              The most common problems that residents face in retirement homes
              are lonliness, depression, and anxiety around memory loss.
            </p>
            <p>This is why music is so impactful for seniors!</p>
            <p>Music is known to: </p>
            <ol className="music-benefits">
              <li>
                Trigger memories and emotions from the past that allows them to
                reminisce about their youth (Nostolgia).
              </li>
              <li>Reduce stress levels and make residents' happier</li>
              <li>Improves speech and concentration</li>
              <li>Improves memory and recall</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This is why Jane focuses on playing light classics.</p>
            <p>
              By playing songs that the residents' will be familiar with, it
              allows them to travel back in time and remember their favourite
              memories!

            <article className="bonus">

                songs picked out for you!)
              </strong>
              <p>
                We know that your residents want songs that they like and are
                familiar with. If you'd like, you and/or the residents can
                choose 15 songs or Jane can perform a pre-selected, top 15 songs

            <p>
              When you hire Jane for your retirement home, she will send you a
