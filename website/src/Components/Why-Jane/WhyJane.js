            You (activity/recreational therapy directors) are constantly

            a day for Susan, while making sure everyone else can do the
            exercise.
          </p>
          <p>
            You research for hours and hours for new activities because there is
            a voice at the back of your head, whispering, that the residents
            will get sick of bingo soon. (You might be sick of it too...)
          </p>
          <p>
            You even study what health benefits will this activity have for your
            residents, even though it consumes so much of your time and energy.

              <strong>Why Music over other activities?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              The most common problems that residents face in retirement homes
              are lonliness, depression, and anxiety around memory loss.
            </p>
            <p>This is why music is so impactful for seniors!</p>
            <p>Music is known to: </p>
            <ol className="music-benefits">
              <li>
                Trigger memories and emotions from the past that allows them to
                reminisce about their youth (Nostolgia).
              </li>
              <li>Reduce stress levels and make resident's happier</li>
              <li>
                It's a fun social event where everyone can enjoy and share!
              </li>
              <li>Improves speech and concentration</li>
              <li>Improves memory and recall</li>
              <li>Even promoting faster healing</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This is why Jane focuses on playing light classics.</p>
            <p>
              By playing songs that the resident's will remember from their
              youth, it allows them to travel back in time and remember their
              favourite memories!

                Bonus #1: 30 light classics that seniors absolutely love! Curate
                the perfect playlist for your retirement home! (We also have 15
                songs picked out for you!)
              </strong>
              <p>
                We know that your residents want songs that they like and are
                familiar with. So we will send you a list of 30 songs that were
                popular during their time. If you'd like, you and/or the
                residents can choose 15 songs to be performed for the retirement
                home. Or Jane can perform a pre-selected, top 15 songs for most
                retirement homes!

              <strong>Is it in person or online?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>Jane currently only performs online through Zoom.</p>
            <p>
              This is so that she can make sure that the residents are safe.
            </p>
            <p>
              It also makes coordinating with you so much easier! Instead of
              preparing a piano, a mircophone, and a speaker, all you have to do
              is click on a Zoom link!
            </p>
            <p>
              When you hire Jane for your retirement home, she will send you a
              link for the performance 30 minutes prior to the session.
